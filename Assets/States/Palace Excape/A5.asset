  storyText: "As you approach the greenhouse, you hear footsteps. You need to get
    inside, so that you can get to the underground tunnels under a secret door on
    the floor towards the back..\r\n\r\n1. You tread carefully inside, try not to
    get seen.\r\n\r\n2.  You make noise outside, so that whoever is inside will want
    to go out and investigate the sound."
