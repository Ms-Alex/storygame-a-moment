  storyText: "You've awaken to find yourself gasping for air, exposed. In front of
    you, there are at least 10 people; 3 in white coats, and the others in uniforms.
    Armed. Staring at you, . \r\n\r\nYou observe the room, unknown instincts hitting
    you. On your left about a foot away, you spot 2 tables: one is a surgical table,
    the other holds surgical equipment. Your eyes quickly fall on the scalpel. However,
    past the tables is a door, with the words 'Exit' over it.\r\n\r\n1. Grab the scalpel,
    and attempt to rid of those before you.\r\n\r\n2. Escape through the door, taking
    your chances of what lies there after."
